# Buidling-a-Recommender-System-with-RBM
An ML algorithm built using RBM to create a collaborative filtering recommender system to give personalized selection of books

Restricted Boltzmann Machine is a type of Boltzmann Machines that are generative stochastic neural networks that can learn a probability distribution over a set of inputs. Compared to other deep learning models, RBMs are simple to train and can use unsupervised learning with unlabeled data.

This project applies RBMs in collaborative filtering, where the algorithm learns the probability distribution over user-item pairs to make predictions about which items specific users might like based on the preferences of similar users.plies RBMs in collaborative filtering, where the algorithm learns the probability distribution over user-item pairs to make predictions about which items specific users might like based on the preferences of similar users.

The Recommendation Score column scores probabilities of how much the book fits the userâ€™s pre- vious interests. In other words, we can interpret the scores as the likelihood of the user reading and liking this book.
